# io-reference
 Potential reference solution to our homework. Definitely not the only one and no claims about being the 'best' one - the assignment is intentionally vague and short of details so you will work them out with the assigner :)

This one tried to be reasonably efficient (the interface tries to prevent any unneeded memory allocations) and is modelled roughly according to std::ios, all the way through its virtual inheritance (yay!) - but without it's more complex replacable parts (the internal buffer).
